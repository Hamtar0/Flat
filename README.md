Flat
====

Theme Flat for Wordpress available here : [https://github.com/yoarts/flat](https://github.com/yoarts/flat)  
Adapted to PluXml with agreement of the creator.

To install : 

1. upload the folder "flat" to your /themes directory
2. upload the folder hamFlat to your /plugins directory

To use :

1. choose flat theme in your admin panel
2. activate the plugin hamFlat in your admin panel

For the moment, the adaptation is basic because PluXml have not the same functionality than Wordpress but the work is in progress. 

Fell free to ask for certain functionality. ;)
